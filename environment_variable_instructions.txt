For deployment:

Make a file called `environment_variables.txt` in this same directory.

Set the following (case sensitive) variables. Use an equals sign as a separator:

DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS  # IP address. Separate with | for multiple
DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND  # set to django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
DJANGO_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL  # set to something like 'BMB_REGISTRATION <noreply@example.com>'


Do not set this:

DJANGO_DEBUG

Unless you are trying to debug!
